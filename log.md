# The Log

This is where we keep track of what we've been talking about during each metting.
It's written in Markdown, which you can learn how to use [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
We can have a section added each week.
No ugly posts allowed.

## Setting up
### 05-Feb-2020, JGG
I'm not totally sure what we'll end up adding to this repo, but I think having someone log what we do will at least be good practice for using git.
Projects we come up with can either be developed directly here or included as a submodule.
We can also share different resources that might be useful for the group.
